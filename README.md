# 👁️ OmniSight: Next-Gen AI Object Perception Engine

**OmniSight** is a cutting-edge computer vision application powered by the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** deep neural network. It simulates autonomous perception systems by detecting, classifying, and counting objects in real-time with state-of-the-art accuracy.

## 🚀 Mission
The goal of this project is to democratize access to advanced **Object Detection** technologies used in autonomous vehicles and robotics. OmniSight provides a seamless interface to analyze visual data using the latest breakthroughs in **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

## 🧠 Neural Network Capabilities
* **Architecture:** Powered by Ultralytics **YOLOv8 (Nano)** for millisecond-latency inference.
* **Semantic Understanding:** Capable of distinguishing between 80+ distinct object classes (e.g., *Person, Bicycle, Traffic Light, Laptop*).
* **Inventory Analytics:** Automatically aggregates detected entities into a structured statistical report.
* **Dynamic Thresholding:** User-controlled confidence sliders to adjust the AI's sensitivity in real-time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies
* **Core Engine:** Python 3.x
* **AI Model:** Ultralytics YOLOv8
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Image Processing:** OpenCV & PIL
* **Data Ops:** NumPy
